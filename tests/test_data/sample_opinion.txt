In the case of Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of racial segregation in public schools. The Court's unanimous decision overturned Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and its "separate but equal" doctrine.

Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the Court, stating that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal." The Court found that segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race deprives children of minority groups of equal educational opportunities, even when physical facilities and other tangible factors may be equal.

The Court concluded that in the field of public education, the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, segregation of public schools based on race violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

This landmark decision not only transformed American education but also served as a catalyst for the broader civil rights movement, establishing the principle that separate facilities are inherently unequal and violate constitutional rights.
